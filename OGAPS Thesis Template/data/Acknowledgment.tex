\TAMUAcknowledgmentFormat

This section is also optional, limited to four pages. It must follow the Dedication Page (or Abstract, if no Dedication). If listing preliminary pages in Table of Contents, include Acknowledgments. Heading (\MakeUppercase{Acknowledgments}) is bold if major headings are bold. It should be in same type size and style as text. So does vertical spacing, paragraph style, and margins.

I would like to thank Texas A\&M University Office of Graduate and Professional Study to give me this chance to organize the Thesis \LaTeX ~ template. Special Thanks to JaeCee Crawford, Amy Motquin and Christine Brown for carefully reviewing this material.  % use A\&M instead of A$\&$M, not use $A\&M$ as well, the last one won't be bold.
